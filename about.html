            My name is Mayank Kumar. I have completed my B.E in Computer Science
            from Babaria Institute of Technology, Vadodara. The day I got hands
            on my first Android Phone, I was amazed about the variety of apps
            available out there. And then, I started to learn how to build
            mobile applications through Internet. The best teacher out there. I
            was always keen to learn and know about new technologies,
            smartphones and everything which is related to technology. I learned
            how to repair computers, upgrade systems and tried little bit of
            networking too. Now I have also started to spread my knowledge to
            the community by making videos on YouTube beacuse I believe in
            sharing and each of us should do it.
